## FER 2013 Challenge 


### The links to pretrained models along with the accuracy score is provided .

#### Model 1  

* the following model gives 65.55 validation accuracy 1.0872

#### Model 2 

* the model gave 66.245 validation accuracy  loss 0.9982

* it was optimized using normalizationa and using new dropout values


## Model 3 

* it gave 63.352 accuracy  loss 1.196

* addind 2 more conv2d layers and a dense layer didn't help

* Since the performance decreased, we are not providing a link for the model
# Model 4

* Final tuning for days incresed the accuracy a little

* The parameters for dropout , etc were changed along with other parameters.

* The final accuracy came out to be 67.66 %
